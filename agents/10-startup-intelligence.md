# Agent: Startup Intelligence & Frameworks

## Mission
Build the structured startup knowledge layer that makes CrowdForge feel like it was built by experienced operators, not random people. Provide templates, health scores, automated monitoring, and guided frameworks that give contributors "order to the chaos" while preserving the free-flowing "Yes, and..." improv energy.

## The Philosophy
"Constrain the process, not the output." Improv has scene formats, time limits, game mechanics — structure that enables spontaneity. CrowdForge should feel the same: free-flowing on the surface, structured underneath.

## What to Build

### Idea Evaluation Scorecard
Weighted criteria across four dimensions:
- Market/Problem (is this real? how big?)
- Solution/Differentiation (why this? why now?)
- Execution Feasibility (can this group build it?)
- Traction/Validation (any evidence of demand?)
Voters in the Idea Ring should see this scorecard alongside each pitch.

### Project Health Dashboard
Automated health score: `Growth (0-25) + Engagement (0-25) + Team (0-25) + Validation (0-25) = 0-100`
- Green (70+): healthy
- Yellow (40-69): needs attention
- Red (<40): at risk
With contextual recommendations ("Your contributor count dropped 30% — consider posting help-wanted tasks")

### Milestone Templates
Stage-appropriate milestones every project should track:
1. Problem Validation — talked to users, confirmed pain point
2. MVP — minimum viable product deployed
3. First Users — organic users (not friends)
4. First Revenue — someone paid money
5. Growth — sustainable traction metrics

### Revenue Model Playbooks
Templates for common models:
- SaaS (MRR tracking, churn, LTV/CAC)
- Marketplace (GMV, take rate, liquidity)
- Content (traffic, engagement, ad revenue)
- API (usage, pricing tiers, developer adoption)
Each with benchmark targets and critical questions to answer.

### Automated Monitoring
- Ad performance tracking (ROAS, CPA, conversion by channel)
- User interest signals (signups, engagement, retention curves)
- Growth rate benchmarking with contextual messages
- Competitive intelligence alerts (similar products launching)
- Pivot/persevere/kill decision framework based on metrics

### Knowledge Base
Three-layer architecture:
- **Playbooks** — linear learning paths (like YC Startup School)
- **Reference Cards** — quick lookup (like cheat sheets)
- **Case Studies** — narrative examples from successful CrowdForge projects (and external examples initially)

## Reference Docs
- `12-startup-frameworks/analysis.md` — complete research with templates, scoring rubrics, content structure
- `06-architecture/design.md` — dashboard designs
- `04-business-model/design.md` — revenue model details

## Constraints
- Frameworks should guide, not prescribe. Language: "Consider..." not "You must..."
- Templates are starting points, not requirements. Projects can ignore them.
- Voice: like Paul Graham essays — opinionated but earned. Not like a textbook.
- The intelligence layer should get smarter over time (this is the data moat — see `07-moat-defensibility/design.md`)
