# CrowdForge Content Strategy

How CrowdForge creates attention, converts spectators, and builds a community that markets itself.

---

## Content Pillars

### 1. Live Build Streams
"Watch something real being built — live, in the open."

The forge stream is CrowdForge's native content format. Real-time code, task movement, karma flowing, deals closing — all visible. This is Twitch Plays Pokemon for building real things.

**Formats:**
- Forge stream embed on landing page (always-on)
- Time-lapse recordings: "24 hours of Scene #3 in 4 minutes"
- Highlight reels: "The moment a stranger found the bug that saved PetMatch"
- Milestone clips: "Scene #7 ships to production — watch the deploy"

**Distribution:** YouTube, X clips, landing page, Discord

### 2. Meta-Content (Dogfooding Narrative)
"We're building CrowdForge on CrowdForge."

The most compelling proof that the model works is using it to build itself. Every decision, every deploy, every revenue split — documented.

**Formats:**
- Daily build-in-public posts from the founder
- Weekly "What the swarm built" newsletter digest
- Decision logs: "Why we chose X over Y (and the karma score that decided it)"
- Failure post-mortems: "Scene #2 failed. Here's what we learned."

**Distribution:** X threads, newsletter, blog, HN

### 3. Founder Build-in-Public
"Transparent, honest, from-the-trenches."

The founder is the face. Personal account, not brand account. Real numbers, real struggles, real celebrations.

**Formats:**
- Daily X post: what was built, karma earned, interesting AI moments
- Weekly thread: metrics roundup (contributors, scenes, revenue, karma distributed)
- Monthly essay: deeper reflection on what's working and what isn't
- Podcast appearances: Indie Hackers, My First Million, Lenny's Podcast

**Distribution:** Founder's X, newsletter, podcast circuit

### 4. Community Content
"Contributor spotlights, payout stories, project showcases."

User-generated content is the scaling engine. Payout cards, build stories, scene retrospectives.

**Formats:**
- Payout card social shares (the viral unit)
- Contributor spotlight interviews: "How @carol earned $2.4K reviewing PRs"
- Scene retrospectives: project teams document their own journey
- Community AMAs with high-karma contributors

**Distribution:** X, Discord, newsletter, YouTube

## Channel Strategy

### Tier 1 — 80% of effort

**Hacker News (Show HN)**
- 10K–50K visits in 24 hours for a successful launch
- Must be a real, working product — no vaporware
- Lead with mechanism: karma formula, revenue split math, anti-gaming measures
- Address skepticism directly in comments
- Best format: "Show HN: [X] builders shipped [thing] on CrowdForge — pitch to revenue in [Y] days"

**Product Hunt**
- Launch Tuesday–Thursday, 8–9am PT
- 4–6 weeks prep: cultivate hunter, prep assets, coordinate upvote community
- Target: 200–350 upvotes for top-5 placement
- Founder as the face, not a brand account

**YouTube**
- Short demo walkthroughs showing the "magic moment" (stranger joins, contributes, earns karma)
- Time-lapses of real scenes being built from scratch
- "Behind the karma" explainer series

### Tier 2 — 15% of effort

**Discord**
- Core contributor community, not support channel
- Target: 500+ members pre-launch
- Channels: #scenes, #karma-questions, #build-in-public, #introductions
- Celebrate milestones publicly, archive learnings

**X / Twitter**
- Founder account: build-in-public threads, daily metrics
- Brand account: retweet payout cards, contributor milestones
- Target: founder at 1K+ followers pre-launch
- Quote-tweet strategy: amplify every payout card shared

**Newsletter**
- "What the swarm built" weekly digest
- Target: 1K+ subscribers pre-launch
- Tone: specific, metric-forward, no fluff
- Include: scenes shipped, karma distributed, revenue flowing, featured contributor

### Tier 3 — 5% of effort

**Reddit**
- r/SideProject: builder story angle
- r/startups: economics and model angle
- r/programming: technical architecture angle
- r/Entrepreneur: income and ownership angle

**LinkedIn**
- "Future of work" narrative for professional audience
- Longer-form posts on the economic thesis
- Target: non-technical professionals curious about new work models

**Podcasts**
- 3–5 appearances in months 1–2
- Targets: Indie Hackers, My First Million, Lenny's Podcast, Software Engineering Daily
- Pitch angle: "an improv stage where anyone walks on and the ensemble builds, ships, and shares the revenue"

## Viral Mechanics

### The Payout Card
The atomic unit of organic growth. A shareable social card showing:
- Amount earned
- Project name
- Contribution summary
- CrowdForge branding

**Why it works:** Combines builder pride ("I built this") with proof the model works ("real revenue") and invitation ("you could do this too"). Three psychological triggers in one shareable asset.

**Amplification:** Founder quote-tweets every payout card. Community celebrates in Discord. Newsletter features top earners weekly.

### The Spectator → Contributor Pipeline
1. Someone sees a payout card or forge stream clip on X
2. They visit the landing page and watch the live forge stream
3. FOMO + curiosity: "I could do that"
4. They join a scene with a micro-task (intentionally low barrier)
5. First karma earned → dopamine hit → habit loop begins
6. They share their own payout card → cycle repeats

### K-Factor Targets
- Pre-PMF: K = 0.15–0.25 (founder-driven growth is expected)
- Post-first-viral: K = 0.4–0.6 (payout cards + build streams compounding)
- PMF signal: K > 1.0 (organic viral growth)

## Content Production Principles

1. **Authenticity over polish.** A terminal screenshot with real data beats a designed graphic with placeholder numbers.
2. **Specificity over aspiration.** "$347 from 3 functions and 2 PRs" beats "earn money building things."
3. **Contributor voice over brand voice.** Reshare their words. Amplify their stories. The community is the content engine.
4. **Failure is content.** Scenes that didn't work are as valuable as successes. Post-mortems build trust.
5. **Never claim AI credit.** The brand is human-first — always.

## Magic Metric

**"Contributors who earn first karma within 48 hours of joining."**

This is the north star activation metric. All onboarding, content, and community design should drive toward making this happen for every new contributor. The 48-hour karma moment is the equivalent of Facebook's "7 friends in 10 days."

## Knowledge Base Content

CrowdForge should feel like it was built by people who've done this before. The knowledge base serves both contributors and scene founders.

### Embedded Frameworks
- **Lean Canvas:** Auto-generated for every new scene
- **Idea Evaluation Scorecard:** Structured rubric for community voting
- **Go-to-Market Playbook:** Templates for scenes ready to launch
- **Project Health Dashboard:** Automated metrics (growth rate, engagement, velocity, validation signals)

### Voice for Guides
Authoritative but not prescriptive. Like Paul Graham advising a friend, not a textbook lecturing a student.

- "The best scenes do X. Here's why."
- "Here's the framework. Adapt it to your scene."
- "This is what the data says. Make your own call."
