# Landing Page Creative Brief

The landing page should NOT explain CrowdForge. It should SHOW it happening. The spectacle IS the marketing. You don't advertise Twitch Plays Pokemon — you clip the moment 80,000 people accidentally release their best Pokemon and it goes viral on its own.

## Hero Section

Instead of tagline + screenshot, the hero should convey real-time creative energy.

**Options:**

1. A live or simulated view of a Scene being built — strangers riffing, ideas forking, things shipping.

2. The "Yes, And..." chain as storytelling device:

   > "What if we made a tool that tracks coffee shop wifi speeds?"
   > "Yes, and what if it also showed how crowded they are right now?"
   > "Yes, and what if it let you reserve a quiet seat?"
   > [3 strangers built this in 4 hours. It made $2,400 last month.]

## Tagline Territory

Not about building or earning. About the UNEXPECTED.

- "Finish each other's startups."
- "One idea. A hundred strangers. Something nobody expected."
- "You bring the spark. Strangers bring the fire."

Energy: "come see what happens" — not "we help you build."

## What the Landing Page Should NOT Do

- Don't explain the karma system
- Don't show pricing tiers
- Don't list features
- Don't say "AI-powered" or "collaborative platform"
- Don't lead with money/revenue
- Don't show Gantt charts or project management UI

All that lives deeper in the funnel. The landing page has one job: make someone think "I need to see this."

## Sections

### 1. Hero

The creative spectacle. "Yes, And..." energy. One strong tagline.

### 2. The Chain

Show a "Yes, And..." chain — an idea evolving through stranger riffs into a shipped product. This is the narrative spine: someone says "what if," others build on it, and what comes out the other end is something none of them could have imagined alone.

### 3. Live Stage

A window into Scenes being built right now (or recently). Activity, energy, people creating. Not a dashboard — a glimpse of something alive.

### 4. The Model (briefly)

"100% of revenue goes to the people who built it. The platform runs on community donations."

One line. That's it.

### 5. Walk On Stage

CTA. Not "Sign up" — something like "Walk on stage" or "Join a Scene" or "Start riffing."

## Tone

- A friend texting "dude come look at this" — NOT a SaaS homepage
- The product is inherently theatrical. Let it perform.
- Sound like a friend showing you something cool, not a product spec
- De-emphasize money/revenue. Lead with building, creating, and status.

---

## Anti-Patterns

These are internal-only vocabulary — never use on the landing page:
- "cinema-mode"
- "spectator view"
- "alive by default"
- "signature experience"
- "bioluminescent"

Other rejected copy:
- "Founder's Circle" — the tier is called "Inner Circle"
- "Watch strangers build startups together" — too descriptive
- "Strangers and AI agents build..." — negative connotations
- "Everyone builds. Everyone earns." — leads with money
- "Startups are multiplayer now." — gaming metaphor, overused

---

## Format Guidance

- **Mobile-first**: the hero must work on a phone screen
- **Dark theme preferred**: the Stage metaphor
- **Animations**: should feel like ENERGY, not decoration
- **Load time matters more than visual complexity**
