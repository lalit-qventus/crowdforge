# CrowdForge Copy Kit

Approved messaging for all channels. Pull from this document — don't improvise taglines or positioning statements.

## Tagline

**Primary:** Everyone builds. Everything ships.

**Alternates (approved, context-dependent):**

| Tagline | Best for |
|---|---|
| Forged, not founded. | Brand campaigns, merch, conference talks |
| Yes, and... ship it. | Community comms, social, improv-aware audiences |
| Open source capitalism. | HN, thought leadership, provocative essays |
| Fork the economy. | Twitter/X, short-form, edgy contexts |
| Walk on stage. Build something real. | Landing page subtext, onboarding |

**Rejected (do not use):**
- "Watch strangers build startups together" — too descriptive, not edgy
- "Strangers and AI agents build..." — both words carry negative connotations
- "Everyone builds. Everyone earns." — leads with money, wrong signal
- "Startups are multiplayer now." — gaming metaphor, overused in SaaS
- "The platform for collaborative startup building" — corporate death
- "Where ideas become startups" — generic, could be any accelerator

## Hero Messages

### Primary Hero (Landing Page)
> Strangers build startups together.

Sub: Someone shares an idea. Others add to it — design, code, marketing, names. It gets built, deployed, and when it earns money, everyone who helped shares the revenue.

NOTE: The landing page uses plain English only. No "riff," "scene," "ensemble," or "stage." See docs/internal/vocabulary.md for the decoupling rules.

### Technical Hero (Developer Audience)
> Stop vibe-coding alone.
> **The ensemble catches what you miss.**

Sub: Claim tasks on real projects. Ship code alongside the ensemble. Earn karma for every contribution. Revenue flows proportionally. Your work compounds.

### Economic Hero (Earner Audience)
> On freelance platforms, you sell your time.
> **On CrowdForge, you earn ownership.**

Sub: Every merged PR, every closed deal, every design review earns karma. Karma determines your share — and every calculation is transparent. Not a bounty. Not a gig. Ongoing income from things you helped build.

### Spectacle Hero (Viral/Social)
> Pull up a chair.
> **Watch something real get built in real-time.**

Sub: Code, decisions, deploys — all happening live on the forge stream. The ensemble builds in the open. When you're ready, walk on stage yourself.

## Elevator Pitches

### One-line (10 seconds)
CrowdForge is where strangers riff on each other's ideas and build something nobody expected — and when it makes money, 100% goes to the people who made it.

### Three-line (30 seconds)
Anyone can pitch an idea on CrowdForge — a startup, a manga, a cookbook, a game, anything. The community votes, an ensemble forms, and creators start shipping together. Every contribution earns karma, and karma determines your share. No hiring. No equity negotiations. Just walk on stage and create.

### Paragraph (60 seconds)
Pitch an idea on CrowdForge. The community votes. If it resonates, an ensemble self-assembles to build, ship, and monetize it. A karma system tracks every contribution — code, design, growth, bug reports — and the upside is shared proportionally. Every formula is public. Every calculation is auditable. Early contributors earn a pioneer multiplier. Spectators watch live. The audience becomes the builders. This is how things get made now. Everyone builds. Everything ships.

## Payout Card Copy (Viral Unit)

The shareable "payout card" is the nuclear weapon of organic growth. Each card is a social media asset combining income proof with builder pride.

### Template
> I earned **$[amount]** this month building **[Project Name]** on CrowdForge.
> [Contribution summary: e.g., "I wrote 3 functions and reviewed 2 PRs."]
> Zero platform commission. Every dollar earned goes to the ensemble.

### Examples
> I earned **$347** this month building PetMatch AI on CrowdForge. I wrote the matching algorithm and reviewed 4 PRs.

> I earned **$1,240** this month from 3 scenes on CrowdForge. My best scene: FinTrack, where I closed the first enterprise deal.

> I earned **$89** in my first week on CrowdForge. All I did was find a critical bug in NomadDesk. Karma doesn't discriminate.
