# CrowdForge Design Principles

Internal document. Eight principles derived from research into improv theater, open-source collaboration, emergent gameplay, and collective creativity. Each principle includes a concrete implication for platform design.

---

## 1. Additive by default, subtractive by effort

It should be easier to build on an idea than to block one. "Yes, And..." is structurally encoded into the platform's interaction model.

**Implication:** Riffing on a Scene is one click. Proposing removal or rollback requires justification and ensemble consensus. The default action is always additive. Blocking, closing, or rejecting requires friction — not bureaucratic friction, but intentional effort that forces the person to articulate why subtraction serves the Scene better than addition.

## 2. Sidecoach, don't gatekeep

AI intervenes DURING creation with nudges and connections, never BEFORE with approval gates. Borrowed from Viola Spolin's vocabulary: say "avoid" not "don't", "evaluation" not "critique."

**Implication:** No AI pre-approval on Riffs. No automated quality gates before contribution. Instead, AI acts as a sidecoach — suggesting connections between Scenes, nudging contributors toward complementary work, surfacing relevant prior art. The AI whispers suggestions mid-flow; it never stands at the door checking credentials.

## 3. Constraints enable creativity

Like jazz chord changes or r/place's pixel cooldown. Time-boxes, role constraints, and domain mismatches channel creative energy rather than limiting it.

**Implication:** Scenes can have time constraints (48-hour jams), role constraints (max 3 developers, need a designer), and domain-mismatch challenges (pair a backend engineer with a poet). These constraints aren't restrictions — they're the structure that makes improvisation possible. A blank canvas with no constraints produces nothing. A canvas with the right constraints produces breakthroughs.

## 4. Engineer collisions, not consensus

Cross-pollinate domains. Consensus produces committees. Collisions produce breakthroughs.

**Implication:** The platform actively matches contributors from different domains. A data scientist and a graphic novelist working on the same Scene isn't a bug — it's the feature. Recommendation algorithms optimize for creative tension, not skill alignment. The feed surfaces Scenes outside a contributor's comfort zone. Agreement is boring; productive disagreement is where new things come from.

## 5. Let mythology emerge

Twitch Plays Pokemon's Helix Fossil was an accident the community worshipped. Nobody designed it. It emerged from chaos, and the community turned it into shared mythology that bound them together.

**Implication:** Leave space for emergent culture. Don't over-design the social layer. Inside jokes, community legends, running gags, shared narratives — these can't be manufactured. The platform provides the conditions (shared struggle, visible history, inside references) and then gets out of the way. Never explain the joke. Never formalize the meme.

## 6. More work than people, always

Surface unfinished Scenes, unsolved problems, unbuilt features. Scarcity of work kills magic. Abundance of work kills politics.

**Implication:** The platform actively generates and surfaces opportunities. AI suggests new Riffs on existing Scenes. Cross-Scene connections are highlighted. "What if..." prompts appear on idle canvases. The contributor's feed should feel like an infinite buffet of interesting problems. If the ratio of opportunities to contributors ever inverts, intervene immediately — spin up AI-suggested challenges, surface dormant Scenes, create cross-pollination prompts.

## 7. Failure is cheap and celebrated

Fork, restart, pivot, abandon — all trivially easy. "Yes, And..." thrives when failure is free.

**Implication:** Forking a Scene is one action. Abandoning a Scene has zero karma penalty. Pivoting mid-Scene is normal, not shameful. Failed Scenes are visible in the archive as learning artifacts, not hidden as embarrassments. The platform celebrates ambitious failures over safe successes. A contributor who tried ten wild ideas and failed at eight has better karma standing than one who played it safe five times.

## 8. The spectator IS the show

Audience reactions feed back into the Scene. The boundary between watcher and builder is porous.

**Implication:** Audience members aren't passive consumers. Their reactions (votes, suggestions, emoji storms, challenge prompts) are visible to the Ensemble and influence the Scene's direction. Stepping from Audience to Ensemble is a smooth gradient, not a hard gate. Watching a Scene and Riffing on it are separated by a single action. The energy of spectators is fuel for creators — make that energy visible and actionable.
