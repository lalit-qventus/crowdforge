# CrowdForge Philosophy

Internal document. Explains the WHY behind every major platform decision.

---

## 1. Creativity-first, mechanics-second

The platform exists to create the conditions where creative magic happens between strangers. Karma, fraud prevention, revenue models — all serve the creative experience. If a mechanic doesn't make the creative experience better, it doesn't belong.

Every product decision passes through one filter: does this make it more likely that a stranger has a creative breakthrough with another stranger today?

## 2. "Yes, And..." as operating system

Borrowed from improv theater. Every idea is welcomed and built upon. The collective decides what sticks. No central authority. The hive mind decides.

Steve Yegge's "Anthropic Hive Mind" article describes how Anthropic runs internally on this principle — ideas flow freely, the best ones attract energy, and the group self-organizes around what works. CrowdForge externalizes this as a platform. The hive mind isn't a metaphor; it's the core interaction model.

What this means concretely: there is no approval gate on ideas. No committee. No product manager deciding what gets built. Someone throws an idea into the ring, others riff on it, and momentum is the only arbiter.

## 3. The Campfire Model

Also from Yegge: everyone sits around a living prototype and sculpts it together. No spec. No waterfall. The prototype evolves through group sculpting.

Each Scene (project) is a campfire. Contributors swarm around it. The artifact is always alive — always runnable, always viewable, always forkable. You don't plan a campfire; you gather around one and tend it.

This is why the platform emphasizes live prototypes over documents, canvases over backlogs, and ensemble sculpting over assigned tickets.

## 4. Zero-commission, donation-backed

100% of project revenue goes to contributors. The platform takes zero cut.

The platform covers operational costs through voluntary donations from the community. Donations are karma-linked (higher-karma members see donation prompts, get recognition for donating) but never required. Think Wikipedia's donation model applied to a creative platform.

Critical constraints:
- The platform does NOT earn karma.
- The platform does NOT take a percentage.
- The platform does NOT insert itself into the revenue chain.

Contributors built it. Contributors earn from it. The platform is infrastructure, not a landlord.

## 5. Not free labor

People come for the creative magic, but the platform is fair. Contribution is tracked transparently. Revenue is shared based on verified contribution. Pioneers (early contributors) get multiplied rewards through karma mechanics.

The platform never profits from contributors' work. This isn't a gig economy where the platform extracts value from labor. The creative experience is the draw; fair compensation is the floor, not the ceiling.

## 6. More work than people

From Yegge's Golden Age insight: when there's more work than people, nobody fights. When people outnumber work, politics start. Turf wars. Gatekeeping. Ego.

The platform must always surface more opportunities than there are contributors. Unfinished Scenes, unsolved problems, unbuilt features, open Riffs — the backlog of interesting work should feel infinite.

This is an engineering constraint, not a hope. The platform actively generates and surfaces work: AI-suggested Riffs, cross-Scene connection opportunities, domain-mismatch challenges. If a contributor ever feels like there's nothing interesting to do, the platform has failed.

## 7. Death of the ego

From improv: it's a team sport. The scene matters more than any individual performer. People who make it about themselves get naturally excluded — not by moderation, but by the ensemble moving on without them.

The platform's social mechanics reinforce this. Karma rewards collaboration over solo glory. The Ensemble model has no fixed hierarchy. Credit is distributed, not concentrated. The hive mind self-corrects for ego because ego kills the creative chemistry that everyone came for.

## 8. Build for builders who build for fun

Target audience: people who create because creating with strangers is electric. Weekend hackers. Designers who prototype for fun. Writers who jam. Musicians who session.

The money is a consequence, not the motivation. De-emphasize revenue in public-facing messaging. Lead with building, creating, and status. Financial outcomes follow from doing great creative work together — they're never the pitch.

If someone's primary motivation is money, they'll find better ROI elsewhere. If someone's primary motivation is the thrill of making something with strangers, this is the only place that exists.
