# CrowdForge Creative Vision

## Core Positioning

100% of project revenue goes to the people who built it. The platform just keeps the lights on.

CrowdForge is a non-profit creative platform. No equity extraction, no VC optimization loop. The model is closer to Craigslist or Wikipedia than to Lovable or any startup studio. This is the strongest competitive moat: no clone can undercut free, and no VC will fund a competitor to a platform that doesn't extract value.

## The Atomic Creative Unit: The Riff

Every platform has one -- Stack Overflow has Q&A, GitHub has the PR, TikTok has the video. CrowdForge's is the Riff.

A Riff is any creative addition to a Scene:
- A name suggestion ("Call it NomadDesk")
- A user story ("As a remote worker, I want...")
- A wireframe sketch
- A code commit
- A marketing headline
- A pricing model
- A market insight

### Properties

- **Small enough** that anyone can contribute one
- **Creative** -- it adds something that didn't exist; not a comment or approval
- **Composable** -- every Riff can be riffed on (TikTok Duet model). A name Riff gets riffed into a logo. A wireframe gets riffed into code.
- **Visible** -- appears in the Scene timeline with the same visual weight regardless of type. Code riffs don't outrank design riffs.
- **Format-aware** -- the card renders natively: code as code, designs as images, copy as rendered text, business models as structured cards

## The Five Moments That Matter

In order of emotional importance:

1. **"Someone riffed on my riff."** A stranger built on your contribution. Your name suggestion became a logo. Your wireframe became code. This is the core magic -- creative compounding between strangers. This is the moment that creates addiction.
2. **"I watched it get built."** Spectator-to-builder conversion. You watched a Scene on the Forge Stream, had an idea, stepped on stage, dropped your first Riff. The barrier was low enough that you did it.
3. **"The Scene shipped."** Collective achievement. 47 strangers built this. It's live. It's earning revenue. Everyone's name is in the credits. The Great British Bake Off finale feeling.
4. **"My first karma."** Proof of belonging. Your Riff earned karma. You're in the ensemble. Your avatar is on the Scene.
5. **"My first payout."** Proof the model works. The shareable moment. The viral card.

Karma and payouts are moments 4 and 5, not 1 and 2. The creative magic comes first. The mechanics validate it.

## What It Should Feel Like

**The Stage** (platform level): Walking into a theater where multiple shows are playing simultaneously. You hear the hum. You see activity counts. The live pulse is the ambient heartbeat. The question isn't "what should I do?" -- it's "which Scene should I watch, or which one should I join?"

**The Scene** (project level): Stepping backstage during rehearsal. The ensemble is working. You see who's doing what. The canvas is filling up -- it looks richer as more people contribute. The Riff timeline shows the idea evolving from a single sentence to a live product.

**The Riff** (contribution level): Stepping on stage and improvising. You're not filling out a form. You're adding creative energy to something with momentum. When the ensemble upvotes your Riff, validation is immediate.

## Design Principles

1. **Additive by default, subtractive by effort.** Easier to build on an idea than to block one. The platform structurally encodes "Yes, And..."
2. **Sidecoach, don't gatekeep.** The AI intervenes during creation with nudges and connections -- "This Scene has overlap with three others, want to see them?" -- never before with approval gates.
3. **Constraints enable creativity.** Like jazz chord changes or r/place's pixel cooldown. Time-boxes, role constraints, domain mismatches channel energy rather than bottleneck it.
4. **Engineer collisions, not consensus.** Cross-pollinate domains. Surface a logistics idea to a healthcare person. Consensus produces committees. Collisions produce breakthroughs.
5. **Let mythology emerge.** TPP's Helix Fossil was an accident the community chose to worship. Leave space for inside jokes, emergent culture, shared narratives.
6. **More work than people, always.** The moment contributors fight over the same tasks, the magic dies. Aggressively surface unfinished Scenes, unsolved problems, unbuilt features.
7. **Failure is cheap and celebrated.** Fork, restart, pivot, abandon -- all trivially easy. "Yes, And..." thrives when failure is free.
8. **The spectator IS the show.** Like Twitch chat IS the gameplay. Audience reactions feed back into the Scene. The boundary between watcher and builder is porous.

## What CrowdForge Should NOT Feel Like

- Not a project management tool (no Gantt charts, no sprint boards)
- Not a freelance marketplace (no bidding, no proposals)
- Not a hackathon (not a weekend event -- an ongoing creative economy)
- Not a DAO (no governance tokens, no voting fatigue)
- Not a code repository (not code-first -- creation-first)

It should feel like the backstage of a theater company where anyone can walk in, watch the rehearsal, and if they have something to contribute, they step on stage and the ensemble makes room.

## Reward Philosophy

The pitch is the jam session. The venue pays the band.

- You come for the creative magic, not the payout
- The reward is automatic and visible -- you don't invoice, karma accrues as you create, payouts happen quarterly
- The platform's cut covers infrastructure only (server costs, fraud protection, deployment tooling)
- Never show hourly rates or per-Riff earnings -- the moment someone calculates "I earned $3.50/hour," the magic dies
- Show karma earned, tier progress, Scene revenue, quarterly payout -- but never the math that reduces creative contribution to hourly wages
- Karma tiers (Observer through Inner Circle) are status in a creative community, like belt colors in martial arts -- the payout is a side effect of having a black belt, not the reason you train
