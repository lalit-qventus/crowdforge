## Core Insights

### The Golden Age Rule
"More work than people, always." When there's more work than people, nobody fights over territory. When there are more people than work, politics and empire-building begin. Google's Golden Age ended when Larry Page cut 50% of the work but kept every engineer. Amazon's lasted longer because everyone was "always slightly oversubscribed."

**CrowdForge implication:** The platform must aggressively generate and surface unfinished Scenes, unsolved problems, unbuilt features. The frontier must always be expanding.

### The Campfire Model
A living prototype at the center. No waterfall, no spec. The prototype evolves via group sculpting into the final product. "You know it when you finally find it."

Anthropic does not produce an operating plan ahead more than 90 days. They are vibing on the shortest cycles and fastest feedback loops imaginable.

**CrowdForge implication:** A Scene IS a campfire. The Riff timeline is the sculpting process made visible.

### "Yes, And..." Improv at Scale
Anthropic's hive mind is described by employees as improvisational theater. Every idea is welcomed, examined, savored, and judged by the hive mind. No central decision-making authority. Forward progress via mashups and exploration. "Like a floodfill search."

**CrowdForge implication:** This is the core mechanic. Riffs build on Riffs. The platform structurally encodes "Yes, And..."

### Full Transparency / Death of the Ego
SageOx (3-person startup) streams entire work history — every false start, mistake, wrong turn. "Everyone can see exactly how fast you work. There is nothing you can hide." The forensics are valuable for merging and context.

But: "Most developers would be really uncomfortable with that." Yegge advised making work hideable as a transitional step.

**CrowdForge implication:** The Forge Stream captures this. Consider draft/private mode for Riffs before going public — lower the psychological barrier to first contribution.

### The Centrifuge
The hive mind naturally ejects non-contributors. "If you interfere with the hive mind operation, you'll gently be pushed out to the edges." It's organic, not punitive.

**CrowdForge implication:** Community-driven quality filtering is more sustainable than formal anti-fraud. Bad actors don't get banned — they get ignored. Their Riffs earn no upvotes. They drift to the periphery.

### Building for Yourself
"Build something just for yourself, and make sure you love it so much that you know it's how other people should be working." Settlers of Catan was playtested by Teuber's own family for years.

### Velocity as Signal
"Claude Cowork was launched publicly 10 days after they first had the idea. When magic happens, it happens very fast."

**CrowdForge implication:** Scene velocity (time from first Riff to shipped product) is the PMF signal.

## What Yegge Doesn't Address (CrowdForge's Novel Challenge)
Yegge describes hive minds within companies (Anthropic) and tiny teams (SageOx). Everyone is on payroll. CrowdForge is trying to create a hive mind of strangers with an economic incentive layer. Making "Yes, And..." work with anonymous strangers and real money is the actual innovation — and the hard part.
