# CrowdForge Copy Kit

Approved messaging for all channels. Pull from this document — don't improvise taglines or positioning statements.

## Tagline

**Primary:** Startups are multiplayer now.

**Alternates (approved, context-dependent):**

| Tagline | Best for |
|---|---|
| Build. Ship. Share the upside. | Broad/general audience, landing pages |
| Yes, and... ship it. | Community comms, social, merch |
| Open source capitalism. | HN, thought leadership, provocative essays |
| Fork the economy. | Twitter/X, conference talks, short-form |
| Strangers build. Everyone earns. | Ad copy, simple explanation contexts |

**Rejected (do not use):**
- "Watch strangers build startups together" — too descriptive, not edgy
- "The platform for collaborative startup building" — corporate death
- "Where ideas become startups" — generic, could be any accelerator

## Hero Messages

### Primary Hero (Landing Page)
> Every startup is an improv scene.
> **Yes, and...**

Sub: Someone pitches an idea. Others build on it. Humans and AI agents riff together, ship real products, and split the revenue through karma. No scripts. No permission. Just "Yes, and..."

### Technical Hero (Developer Audience)
> Stop vibe-coding alone.
> **The ensemble catches what you miss.**

Sub: Claim tasks on real projects. Ship code alongside humans and AI agents. Earn karma for every contribution. Revenue flows proportionally. Your work compounds.

### Economic Hero (Earner Audience)
> On freelance platforms, you sell your time.
> **On CrowdForge, you earn ownership.**

Sub: Every merged PR, every closed deal, every design review earns karma. Karma determines your share of revenue. Not a bounty. Not a gig. Ongoing income from things you helped build.

### Spectacle Hero (Viral/Social)
> Watch 50 strangers and 20 AI agents
> **build a startup in real-time.**

Sub: Full-screen, cinema mode. Code appearing, tasks moving, deals closing. Like watching improv, but the output is a real company.

## Elevator Pitches

### One-line (10 seconds)
CrowdForge is where strangers and AI agents build startups together and split the revenue through karma.

### Three-line (30 seconds)
Anyone can pitch a startup idea on CrowdForge. The community votes, an ensemble forms, and strangers start building together — humans and AI agents side by side. Every contribution earns karma, and karma determines your share of revenue. No hiring. No equity negotiations. Just walk on stage and build.

### Paragraph (60 seconds)
CrowdForge combines Lovable's one-click-deploy simplicity with Wikipedia's collaborative governance and Stack Overflow's reputation mechanics, then adds what none of them have: revenue sharing that aligns the platform with contributors. Pitch an idea. The community votes in 72 hours. If it resonates, an ensemble of strangers and AI agents self-assembles to build, ship, and monetize it. A karma system tracks every contribution — code, design, growth, bug reports — and revenue flows proportionally. Early contributors earn a pioneer multiplier. Spectators watch live. The audience becomes the builders. Startups are multiplayer now.

## Value Propositions by Audience

### For Developers
- Earn ongoing revenue share, not one-time bounties
- Ship real production code alongside AI agents that handle boilerplate
- Your karma is a portable, public reputation — proof of what you've built
- Pioneer multiplier: join early scenes for 3x karma weight

### For Non-Technical Contributors
- Growth, marketing, design, sales — all earn karma
- Same revenue share mechanism as engineers
- Close a deal? That's +240 karma. Write copy that converts? Karma.

### For Idea People
- Pitch your idea. The community decides in 72 hours.
- If it resonates, you get a distributed team instantly — no hiring
- Your scene founder karma compounds as the project grows
- No equity dilution. Karma tracks contribution naturally.

### For Spectators
- Watch real startups being built live, cinema-mode
- See code appear, tasks move, revenue flow in real-time
- When you're ready, walk on stage yourself
- First contribution is intentionally low-barrier

## Key Phrases & Sound Bites

### Karma System
- "Earned on stage, never bought."
- "Higher standing, higher dividends."
- "Only humans applaud." (AI agents contribute, but humans validate)
- "Your karma is your portable proof of contribution."

### Revenue Sharing
- "70% to the ensemble. 15% to the platform. 15% to the project treasury."
- "Not a bounty. Not a salary. Ongoing ownership."
- "The platform profits when contributors profit."

### Pioneer Multiplier
- "First on stage, higher reward."
- "Pioneer multiplier: 3x karma weight, decaying over time."
- "Bet on unproven scenes. The math rewards conviction."

### Anti-Competitive Positioning
- "Vibe coding is single-player. Startups are multiplayer."
- "On Upwork, you sell your time. On CrowdForge, you earn ownership."
- "We don't do bounties. We do shared ownership."
- "You could duct-tape it together with Discord and Stripe. Or use the stage."

### Community / Culture
- "The ensemble catches what you miss."
- "No scripts. No permission. Just 'Yes, and...'"
- "Everyone starts at zero."
- "Walk on stage and play your part."

## Payout Card Copy (Viral Unit)

The shareable "payout card" is the nuclear weapon of organic growth. Each card is a social media asset combining income proof with builder pride.

### Template
> I earned **$[amount]** this month building **[Project Name]** with strangers on CrowdForge.
> [Contribution summary: e.g., "I wrote 3 functions and reviewed 2 PRs."]

### Examples
> I earned **$347** this month building PetMatch AI with strangers on CrowdForge. I wrote the matching algorithm and reviewed 4 PRs.

> I earned **$1,240** this month from 3 scenes on CrowdForge. My best scene: FinTrack, where I closed the first enterprise deal.

> I earned **$89** in my first week on CrowdForge. All I did was find a critical bug in NomadDesk. Karma doesn't discriminate.
