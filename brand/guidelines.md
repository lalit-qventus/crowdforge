# CrowdForge Brand Guidelines

The canonical reference for CrowdForge's brand identity, voice, and visual system. All agents, content creators, and collaborators should treat this document as the source of truth.

---

## Brand Essence

**Tagline:** Startups are multiplayer now.

**One-sentence pitch:** CrowdForge is where strangers and AI agents build, deploy, and monetize startups together — an improv stage for collective creation where karma tracks contribution and revenue is split proportionally.

**Brand personality in three words:** Alive. Earned. Unscripted.

---

## The Improv Principle

CrowdForge borrows its soul from improv theater. The "Yes, and..." philosophy isn't decoration — it's the operating system.

| Improv Rule | CrowdForge Expression |
|---|---|
| "Yes, and..." | Ideas are welcomed and built upon, never shut down |
| The ensemble creates | No single founder — the collective builds |
| Scenes, not scripts | Projects emerge organically, not by decree |
| Everyone gets stage time | Karma is earned, not assigned by hierarchy |
| The audience matters | Spectator mode is a first-class experience |

**Language implication:** We say "scene" not "project." We say "ensemble" not "team." We say "stage" not "platform." We say "take the stage" not "sign up." We say "standing ovation" not "milestone reached."

## Voice & Tone

### The Voice
CrowdForge sounds like a founder who's built things advising a friend who's about to. Direct. Specific. Honest. Never corporate, never academic, never hype.

**Benchmark voices:**
- Paul Graham essays (clear thinking, strong opinions, simple language)
- First Round Review (operational depth, specific numbers)
- Improv comedy stage banter (spontaneous, energetic, yes-and energy)

### Tone Spectrum

| Context | Tone |
|---|---|
| Landing page / marketing | Provocative, confident, punchy |
| Onboarding / product | Warm, encouraging, specific |
| Documentation / guides | Authoritative but not prescriptive |
| Error states / failures | Honest, constructive, no sugarcoating |
| Community / social | Energetic, celebratory, peer-to-peer |

### Voice Rules

1. **Specific over aspirational.** Numbers, metrics, real outcomes. Not superlatives.
2. **Active over passive.** "You earn karma" not "Karma is awarded."
3. **Short over long.** If you can cut a word, cut it.
4. **Show over tell.** "Watch 50 strangers build a SaaS product" beats "collaborative startup creation platform."
5. **Provocative over safe.** "Startups are multiplayer now" beats "build startups together."

### Word Choice

| Use | Don't Use |
|---|---|
| karma | points, tokens, credits |
| scene | project (external comms) |
| ensemble | team, crew, squad |
| stage | platform, marketplace |
| revenue share | payout, salary, bounty |
| earned | granted, awarded, purchased |
| contributor | freelancer, contractor, worker |
| spectator | visitor, viewer |
| pioneer | early adopter, beta tester |

### Forbidden Language

- "DAO," "token," "staking," "governance token," "blockchain," "decentralized," "web3" — triggers instant skepticism
- "AI-generated," "Built with AI," "AI-powered" — the brand is human-first even though AI agents are core
- "Disrupting," "revolutionizing," "game-changing" — corporate vapidity
- "Leverage," "synergy," "scalable" — business school noise
- "Simple," "easy," "just" — diminishes the complexity people respect

## Visual Identity

### Color System

**Primary Palette**

| Name | Hex | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| Deep Black | `#0d0907` | Primary background |
| Surface | `#161110` | Card/panel backgrounds |
| Elevated | `#1e1816` | Secondary surfaces, inputs |

**Accent Palette**

| Name | Hex | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Amber | `#f5a623` | Primary accent — CTAs, highlights, brand mark |
| Coral | `#ff6b6b` | Secondary accent — urgency, live states, improv energy |
| Violet | `#a78bfa` | AI agent identity |
| Teal | `#2dd4bf` | Human contributor identity |
| Gold | `#ffd700` | Karma, revenue, achievement |

**Text Hierarchy**

| Name | Hex | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| Primary | `#f0e6d3` | Headlines, body text |
| Secondary | `#9a8e80` | Descriptions, supporting text |
| Muted | `#4d4239` | Timestamps, labels, disabled |

**Glow Effects**

Amber glow: `0 0 40px rgba(245, 166, 35, 0.15), 0 0 80px rgba(245, 166, 35, 0.05)`
Coral glow: `0 0 40px rgba(255, 107, 107, 0.12)`

Glow is used sparingly to create "stage light" ambiance. Pulsing glow on live elements. Static glow on interactive elements on hover.

### Typography

| Role | Font | Weight | Usage |
|---|---|---|---|
| Display | Bricolage Grotesque | 700–800 | Headlines, hero text, section titles |
| Monospace | JetBrains Mono | 300–600 | Code, labels, timestamps, terminal UI |
| Body | Instrument Sans | 400–700 | Paragraphs, descriptions, UI text |

**Type rules:**
- Display: tight letter-spacing (`-0.03em`), large size, high contrast
- Mono: wide letter-spacing (`0.04em–0.15em`), small caps for labels
- Body: standard spacing, comfortable line-height (`1.6–1.8`)
- Never use Inter, Helvetica, or system fonts in marketing materials

### Motion Principles

Everything on stage is alive. Static = dead. But animation serves meaning, not decoration.

| Element | Motion | Duration |
|---|---|---|
| Stage lights | Slow sway, 8–10s cycle | Ambient |
| Logo mark | Glow pulse, 4s cycle | Ambient |
| Live badge | Pulse glow, 2s cycle | Status indicator |
| Feed lines | Slide up + fade in | 0.5s ease |
| Cards on hover | Translate up + shadow grow | 0.3–0.4s |
| Scroll reveal | Translate up + fade in | 0.8s ease |
| Cursor blink | Step animation | 1s loop |

**Rules:**
- Ambient animations: slow, subtle, organic (breathing, pulsing)
- Interaction animations: quick, responsive, meaningful
- Never: bounce, shake, spin, or attention-hijacking motion
- Reduced motion: respect `prefers-reduced-motion`

### Visual Metaphors

| Concept | Visual |
|---|---|
| The platform | A theater stage, spotlight from above |
| Projects | Scenes being performed |
| Live activity | Terminal/console with streaming feed |
| Contribution | Walking on stage |
| Revenue split | Karma bars with proportional fills |
| Quality | Audience applause / standing ovation |

### Logo

- The forge hammer (⚒) in a rounded square with amber-to-coral gradient
- Pulsing glow animation (the stage light effect)
- Paired with "CrowdForge" in Bricolage Grotesque 800
- Minimum size: 24px icon, never smaller
- Clear space: 1x logo width on all sides

### Anti-Patterns

Do not:
- Use purple gradients as primary (that's Lovable's territory)
- Use generic AI aesthetics (neural networks, circuit boards, robot imagery)
- Use flat corporate illustration styles (Notion, Linear knock-offs)
- Use stock photography of people in offices
- Use bright white backgrounds
- Use rounded-everything soft UI (our edges are intentional)

## Positioning Architecture

### Primary Positioning
CrowdForge is the multiplayer platform where strangers and AI agents build startups together. Unlike vibe coding tools (single-player), freelance marketplaces (transactional), and bounty platforms (one-time), CrowdForge provides ongoing ownership through karma-weighted revenue sharing.

### Positioning by Audience

| Audience | Hook | Mechanism | Differentiator |
|---|---|---|---|
| Developers | Earn ownership building real products | Claim tasks, ship code, earn karma | Unlike freelancing, your contributions compound |
| Non-technical builders | Your skills drive real startup growth | Growth, marketing, design — all earn karma | Unlike freelancing, non-code contributions earn revenue |
| Founders with ideas | Get a fully distributed team instantly | Pitch → community votes → ensemble forms | No hiring, no equity dilution, reputation-weighted |
| Spectators | Watch a startup being built live | Real-time forge stream, cinema mode | The audience becomes the next generation of builders |

### Competitive Positioning

| Competitor | Our line |
|---|---|
| Lovable / Bolt.new | "Vibe coding is single-player. Startups are multiplayer." |
| Upwork / Toptal | "On Upwork, you sell your time. On CrowdForge, you earn ownership." |
| Algora / Gitcoin bounties | "We don't do bounties. We do shared ownership." |
| Colony.io / Coordinape | "Revenue sharing without the blockchain baggage." |
| Claude Code + Discord + Stripe (DIY) | "You could duct-tape it together. Or use the stage that handles contribution tracking, fair splits, trust, deployment, and reputation." |

## Naming

### "CrowdForge" — Current Status

**Strengths:** Semantically clear (crowd + forge), active verb energy, memorable
**Risks:** Namespace collision (crowdforge.io exists, CMU research), crowdforge.com available but premium-priced
**Decision pending:** Acquire .com and differentiate, or rename

**If renaming is needed, candidates must feel:**
- Novel (like "Moltbook" — you've never heard it before)
- Active (verb energy, not passive noun)
- Cultural (references improv, collective creation, emergence)

### Domain Strategy

Priority: `crowdforge.com` acquisition
Fallback: `.dev`, `.sh`, or `.so` with an alternative name
Social handles: Audit X, GitHub, Discord, Product Hunt availability before committing

## Content Principles

1. **Build in public.** Share real data, real failures, real learnings. Developers detect inauthenticity instantly.
2. **Spectacle drives attention.** "Watch 50 strangers and 20 AI agents build a SaaS product" has Twitch Plays Pokemon energy.
3. **The payout card is the viral unit.** "I earned $347 building with strangers on CrowdForge" combines gig economy dopamine with developer pride.
4. **Frameworks, not rules.** Present guidance as starting points. "Most successful startups do X. Here's why, and here's how to decide if it applies to you."
5. **Community content over brand content.** Contributor spotlights, payout stories, project showcases > corporate blog posts.

---

## Brand Constraints

1. Never claim AI attribution or credit
2. Never use crypto/blockchain/DAO language
3. Never create content that sounds like it was written by a committee
4. Never promise specific earnings or returns
5. Never position against open source — we're adjacent, not competitive
6. Transparent pricing always — Lovable's #1 complaint is credit unpredictability
7. The brand is human-first, even though AI agents are core participants
